Cloning is the production of living structures genetically identical to their parent structure. Genetic variations are absent.
Cloning occurs naturally in asexually reproducing microbes and vegetatively multiplying plants. Asexually reproducing lower animals like Amoeba proteus.
Monozygotic identical twins are also clones as they are formed by split up of the early 2 or more celled embryo into two equal parts. 
Both of them have the same genetic characteristics. Clone is, therefore, an exact carbon copy or copies of a single living parent. 
Artificial cloning has been achieved in higher animals. Sheep Dolly is a clone of its mother. Cloning is of several typescell cloning.
